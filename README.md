# Build! with Andrew

**Learn to build AI-powered web applications without writing code yourself.**

## About This Course

Build! with Andrew is a hands-on, beginner-friendly course that teaches you how to create working web applications using GenAI tools like ChatGPT and Claude. No coding experience required - just the ability to describe what you want to build.

### What You'll Learn

- ✨ Create functional web apps in minutes using structured AI prompts
- 🎯 Understand how specific prompts produce better results than vague requests
- 🔄 Iterate and refine AI-generated code to customize your applications
- 🛠️ Build reusable templates for real-world work tools
- 🚀 Gain confidence that AI development is accessible to everyone

### Course Structure

**Module 1: Prompt it, build it, use it**

1. **Filling in the blanks** - See what you're about to build
2. **Let's build it** - Create your first interactive web app
3. **Make it yours** - Customize themes, colors, and functionality
4. **You're a Builder!** - Transform your skills into practical tools

## Example Applications

This repository includes several complete HTML applications you can open and run immediately:

### 🎮 Interactive Games
- **Wild Words** (`wild_words.html`) - Nature documentary-themed fill-in-the-blanks game
- **Office Life Mad Libs** (`madlibs.html`) - Workplace humor generator
- **Magic 8 Ball** (`magic8ball.html`) - Mystical decision-making assistant
- **Table Tennis** (`gpt41_tabletennis_it04.html`) - Playable ping pong game

### 💼 Practical Tools
- **Corporate Jargon Translator** (`jargon-translator.html`) - Decode business speak into plain English
- **To-Do List** (`todo-list.html`) - Simple task management app

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Access to a GenAI tool (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)
- Basic computer skills (copy/paste, save files)
- **That's it!** No coding knowledge needed

### How to Use These Examples

1. **Download** any HTML file from this repository
2. **Double-click** the file to open it in your web browser
3. **Use it** immediately - all apps are fully functional
4. **Study** the structure to understand how they work
5. **Customize** by modifying the prompts that created them

## Building Your Own Apps

### The Prompt Template

Every app in this course follows a structured prompt pattern:

```
Goal Statement: What is the end goal and who is it for?

Functionality:
- What should your app do?

Technical Requirements:
- What are your inputs?
- What are your outputs?
- Any restrictions?

Layout:
- What should be on your app?
- Where should it be?

Style:
- Is there a theme?
- What fonts, colors, and images do you want?
```

### Example Prompt (from the course)

```
Create an HTML page for a fill-in-the-blank word game with a 
nature documentary theme.

The story should have a dramatic wildlife documentary tone, but 
the creature is doing something mundane and absurd.

Five input fields for: a mundane place, creature, body part, 
food item, and a past-tense verb.

Include placeholder examples for each.

Two columns in a centered card. Form on the left, generated 
story on the right.

Make it have a light jungle theme with soft greens and a 
playful title font.
```

## Key Learning Principles

### Show, Don't Tell
- See working examples before learning theory
- Experience outcomes before explanations
- Build confidence through immediate wins

### Structured Prompting Works Better
The course demonstrates why:
- **Vague**: "Make me a game" → unpredictable results
- **Structured**: Detailed requirements → consistent, quality outputs

### Iteration Is Essential
- Start with basics
- Add features incrementally
- Test and refine continuously
- Build on what works

## Final Project

Complete the course by building your own practical web application that includes:

- ✅ 3-5 input fields with placeholder text
- ✅ A button that transforms input into output
- ✅ Display area for results
- ✅ Something you'll actually use or share with friends

## Who This Course Is For
